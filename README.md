# Ping-Pong
A simple ping pong game made from scratch, using only C++ and SFML.

Download the source code first and extract it anywhere, then download the executable (.exe) file and put it into the source code folder.

Use WASD to control Player 1 (bottom side) and arrow keys to control Player 2 (top side).
To exit the game, simply press ESC.
You can also play with the source code if you want to.
